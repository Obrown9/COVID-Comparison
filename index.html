  <p>The moment the Coronavirus escaped China and entered countries across the world, nobody knew where to start. It was total chaos for many countries including the United States. There was no bread or milk at grocery stores, masks and sanitizers disappeared in an instant, businesses shut down, and nobody knew how to act. With a raging pandemic, it took Pfizer only nine months to create a working vaccine. Within a year, many Americans had both doses of the vaccine, but some were slower to act and were skeptical of the product. Now, almost three years removed from the beginning, vaccinations are almost required for most aspects of life. It took a long time for some to get on board. Celebrities and athletes both had concerns because they had no idea what they were putting into their body. We take a look back to the place where it all began, and think, how is it still so bad there, even with their Zero COVID Policy.</p>

  <h3>What Does the Future Hold?</h3>
</div>

<div class="article">
  <p>We look ahead at the years to come. With 2023 less than a month away, will there be significant change in China to try and stop the spread and discontinue the Zero COVID Policy? There just should not be that many cases when the country is still essentially shut down. For the United States, COVID is still impacting everyday life. There are no states requiring the wearing of masks at this point in time. But, judging from the numbers, COVID cases are in high supply. It feels like a transition period for the United States, as we try to move past the horrors of the last 3 years. For China, it’s more of the same, which seems to be a regular occurrence for the most populous country in the world.</p>
